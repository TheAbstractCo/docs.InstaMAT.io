# Welcome to InstaMAT
Discover new ways to create materials with limitless variations and leverage fully scalable automation that will reshape your content creation pipeline.

InstaMAT includes hundreds of different image processing algorithms: from automatically computing an ambient occlusion map from an input height map to baking meshes directly in an Element graph. It's unprecedented! The *InstaMAT Library Reference* will assist you on your path to master InstaMAT and help you establish a workflow that elevates your team's creativity.

If you are new to InstaMAT taking a quick look at the *InstaMAT Library Reference* can help you understand what's at your dispoal. However, a better way to get started is by revising the [InstaMAT documentation](https://www.InstaMaterial.com/GettingStarted). The InstaMAT documentation will provide you with advice on how the application works and covers everything you need to know on the app level: from navigating the user-interface to understanding how you can build both Atom and Element Graphs.

> The technology behind InstaMAT is also available as C++ SDK. This means that you can integrate our technology into your app or native pipeline to dynamically execute Atoms and Elements. 
>	More information is available on the [InstaMAT SDK documentation](Products/InstaMAT C++ SDK.md) page.


> InstaMAT is also integrated in popular DCC tools and 3D engines such as [RSX Engine](https://www.RSXEngine.com). 
> The documentation for these integration is available individually. 
> More information is availbable here: [InstaMAT Integrations](https://www.InstaMaterial.com/Integrations)

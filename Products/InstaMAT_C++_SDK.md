# InstaMAT C++ SDK
The technology behind InstaMAT is also available as C++ SDK. This means that you can integrate our technology into your app or native pipeline to dynamically execute Atoms and Elements. 

More information is available on the [InstaMAT SDK documentation](https://www.InstaMaterial.com/GettingStartedWithSDK) page.

> There is no difference between the InstaMAT C++ SDK that is available to our customers and partners and what we're using internally to build our own applications and integrations.
> This means that with the InstaMAT C++ SDK you will be able to leverage InstaMAT's powerful processing technology in the same way that the creators are doing it!

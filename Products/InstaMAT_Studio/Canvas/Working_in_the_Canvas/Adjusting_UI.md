# Adjusting the Canvas UI

![GIF of adjusting the Canvas UI]()

InstaMAT Studio's Canvas UI provides many flexible orientations for its panels and views making it easy to focus on the task at hand. The center area of the main window can be adjusted allowing the other panels and views to shift in turn.  Additionally, the [Viewport](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas/Canvas_Interface/Viewport) and [Image Viewer](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas/Canvas_Interface/Image_Viewer) can be moved to the left panel in the main window to provide additional flexibility. To provide more space when needed, many [widgets]() can pop out of their panels into a dedicated window. 

## Cycling the Center View

From the [Canvas Toolbar](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas/Canvas_Interface/Canvas_Toolbar), the Canvas, Viewport, and Image viewer can be chosen as the UI's center view. Choosing which view takes up the center area provides more visual real estate making it easy to do design reviews or concentrate on small details. When a view is chosen, the other views fill in to their respective slots. The screen space of each view is determined by the size of the panel space it resides in.

For example, selecting the <i class="fa-regular fa-cube"></i> Viewport as the center view provides a larger stage to evaluate the project in a physically lit 3D environment.

Choosing the <i class="fa-regular fa-image"></i> Image Viewer is a quick way of observing intricate details on image maps and compositions.

Furthermore, picking the <i class="fa-sharp fa-regular fa-diagram-project"></i> Canvas view fills the UI with the graph and supplies the extra room needed to stay in context as graphs continue to grow and get more complex.

A fast way to cycle through each of the three combinations is by pressing <kbd>Option/Alt + C</kbd>. Quickly, it becomes muscle memory on how many times to press this keyboard shortcut to get the desired orientation.

## Hiding Panels

Clicking on a side panel's icon hides the panel. This provides even more space for the remaining views.

For example, hiding the left panel while working in the Canvas view provides more space to work in the graph while adjusting parameters and using the Viewport.

Another example: Both side panels can be hidden to provide maximum viewing space while the Viewport is the center view.

![Maximum Viewport Space example]()

> Hovering over a panel's icon provides a tooltip displaying it's name and hotkey. Panels on the left are toggled with the number keys alone. Panels on the right are toggled with the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key modifier followed by a number key. To quickly hide a panel, press the hotkey for that panel if it is already open. Pressing the hotkey again will bring it back.

## Moving the Viewport and Image Viewer to the Left Panel

The Viewport and Image Viewer can move to the left panel providing even more flexibility when working in InstaMAT Studio. To move them over, click the !<i class="fa-regular fa-square-arrow-left"></i> icon in the top left corner of the Viewport or Image Viewer. This allows both views to be seen at the same time which is an ideal workspace when building materials with the [Element Graph]().

# Minimap

![Minimap](Images/Minimap_On_Canvas.png)

The **Minimap** is a small representation of the <a href="">Canvas</a> used to quickly navigate and visualize the nodes in the graph. The highlighted square shows the visible portion of the Canvas and adjusts based on the current zoom level. <a href="">Comments</a> in the the Canvas appear with their respective colors making it easy to map out a complex project. 

## Toggling the Minimap

The Minimap can be toggled on and off with the ![Minimap](Images/Minimap.png) icon in the <a href="">Canvas Toolbar</a> or by pressing the shortcut hotkey **Alt/Option + M**.

## Navigation

There are a few ways to navigate the Canvas with the Minimap:

- **Left Click** and drag the highlighted square to pan the Canvas's working area at the current zoom level
- **Left Click** and drag a box over a section of the Minimap to frame up that area in the Canvas's bounds

> At any time, use the **F** key to **Focus** the Canvas so that the entire graph fits the working area.

# Resource Picker

![Resource Picker variants](/instamat_studio/canvas/resource_picker_variants.png)


The **Resource Picker** Panel is a contextual popup panel with access to InstaMAT Studio's library of nodes and assets. This panel provides quick access to the resources in both the <a href="../Graph_Library.html">Graph Library</a> and the <a href="../Package_Management.html">Package Management</a> Panel. To access the Resource Picker Panel, click the ![Pencil Icon](/instamat_studio/canvas/pencil_icon.png) to the right of any Graph Input. The Resource Picker Panel will display compatible results based on the type of input it is providing a resource for.

## Interface Overview

The Resource Picker Panel is almost like a miniaturized <a href="../Graph_Library.html">Graph Library</a> complete with a search bar and set of display options. Once invoked, the search bar is automatically selected to quickly filter available resources. The panel is resizable and can be repositioned by dragging it across the screen.

The Resource Picker Panel contains a dedicated toolbar. The following overviews the available options:

- ![Icon](Images/Show_Objects_From_Current_Package_Icon.png) **Show Objects from the Current Package**: Filters the available resources to only show items from the currently active package

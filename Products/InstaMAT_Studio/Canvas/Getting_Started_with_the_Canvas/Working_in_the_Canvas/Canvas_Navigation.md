# Canvas Navigation

![GIF of navigating the Canvas]()

The Canvas View is navigated by panning and zooming.

## Panning

![Panning GIF]()

To Pan, <kbd>Left Click</kbd> and drag on an empty space. If an object in the Canvas such as a node or comment is in the way of your cursor, hold the <kbd>Space Bar</kbd> to ignore any Canvas objects. 

Additionally, pressing the <kbd>Arrow Keys</kbd> will incrementally pan the Canvas view in the key's direction.

## Zooming

![Zooming GIF]()

To Zoom, <kbd>Right Click</kbd> and drag up or down.

## Mouse Wheel

InstaMAT Studio adapts to the native mouse wheel behavior of the platform it is running on. The mouse wheel by itself will either zoom or perform a vertical scroll. Holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while using the mouse wheel will swap behaviors.

To change the default mouse wheel behavior, choose the behavior in the `Canvas` tab in the <a href="">Preferences</a> panel.

## Selecting Objects

## Moving Objects

To move an object from one place in the graph to another, select the object or objects then <kbd>Left Click</kbd> and drag to the new position.

> If you'd like to pan the Canvas view while dragging an object, drag the object to a border of the Canvas view to pan in that direction. This also works when dragging connections from a node's input or output.

## Focusing

![Focusing GIF]()

Focusing in InstaMAT Studio is a universal term meaning to frame up the contents or a selection so that it fits within the bounds of the view. To focus in the Canvas, use the <kbd>F</kbd> key. To focus on a portion of the graph, select the objects to focus on first, then hit <kbd>F</kbd>.

> Another way to frame up a portion of the graph so that it fits the view is to drag a rectangular selection in the <a href="">Minimap</a>.

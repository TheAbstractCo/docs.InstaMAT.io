# Canvas Navigation

![GIF of navigating the Canvas]()

The Canvas View is navigated by panning and zooming.

## Panning

![Panning GIF]()

To Pan, **Left Click** and drag on an empty space. If an object in the Canvas such as a node or comment is in the way of your cursor, hold the **Space Bar** to ignore any Canvas objects. 

Additionally, pressing the **Arrow Keys** will incrementally pan the Canvas view in the key's direction.

## Zooming

To Zoom, **Right Click** and drag up or down.

## Mouse Wheel

InstaMAT Studio adapts to the native mouse wheel behavior of the platform it is running on. The mouse wheel by itself will either zoom or perform a vertical scroll. Holding the **Shift** key while using the mouse wheel will swap behaviors.

To change the default mouse wheel behavior, choose the behavior in the **'Canvas'** tab in the <a href="../Canvas Interface/Panels and Windows/Preferences.html">Preferences</a> panel.

## Selecting Objects

![Selecting GIF]()

To select nodes or other objects in the Canvas view, **Left Click** the object. To select multiple objects, hold **Shift** and drag a rectangular selection of the objects to select.

## Moving Objects

![Moving Objects GIF]()

To move an object from one place in the graph to another, select the object or objects then **Left Click** and drag to the new position.

> If you'd like to pan the Canvas view while dragging an object, drag the object to a border of the Canvas view to pan in that direction. This also works when dragging connections from a node's input or output.

## Deleting Objects

## Duplicating Objects

## Focusing

![Focusing GIF]()

Focusing in InstaMAT Studio is a universal term meaning to frame up the contents or a selection so that it fits within the bounds of the view. To focus in the Canvas, use the **F** key. To focus on a portion of the graph, select the objects to focus on first, then hit **F**.

> Another way to frame up a portion of the graph so that it fits the view is to drag a rectangular selection in the <a href="../Canvas Interface/Minimap.html">Minimap</a>.

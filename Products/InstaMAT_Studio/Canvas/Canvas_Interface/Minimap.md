# Minimap

![Minimap](/instamat_studio/canvas/minimap_on_canvas.png){.align-center}

The **Minimap** is a small representation of the <a href="">Canvas</a> used to quickly navigate and visualize the nodes in the graph. The highlighted square shows the visible portion of the Canvas and adjusts based on the current zoom level. <a href="">Comments</a> in the the Canvas appear with their respective colors making it easy to map out a complex project. 

## Toggling the Minimap

The Minimap can be toggled on and off with the <i class="fa-regular fa-globe"></i> icon in the <a href="">Canvas Toolbar</a> or by pressing the shortcut hotkey <kbd>Alt/Option + M</kbd>.

## Navigation

There are a few ways to navigate the Canvas with the Minimap:

- <kbd>Left Click</kbd> and drag the highlighted square to pan the Canvas's working area at the current zoom level
- <kbd>Left Click</kbd> and drag a box over a section of the Minimap to frame up that area in the Canvas's bounds

> At any time, use the <kbd>F</kbd> key to **Focus** the Canvas so that the entire graph fits the working area.

# InstaMAT Project Integration

InstaMAT's project types are designed to integrate seamlessly together. `Layering` projects can be used within `Element Graphs` to extend their procedural functionality. Inversly, materials that are created with an `Element Graph` can be used directly as a layer in `Layering`. Materials that were generated from a photo using `Materialize Image` can be added directly to a `Material Layering` project to add more visual complexity. Integrating projects in this manner frees up and expands the many angles from which to approach a project, giving the artist more opportunities to work the way they think.

## Canvas Project Integration
The [Canvas](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas) makes project integration as easy as a drag and drop.

## Package Hirearchy

`Projects` are created and stored inside InstaMAT `Packages`. In addition to multiple projects, packages contain related resources that are to be bundeled with each project such as images, fonts, baked mesh maps, baking settings, meshes, and point clouds. Multiple projects can share the same resources in a package.

Package contents are viewed through the [Package Management](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas/Canvas_Interface/Package_Management) panel.

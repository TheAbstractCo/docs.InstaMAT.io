The New Project screen can be found in a few locations:

- Go to `File` > `New Project` in the main menu
- Click the <i class="fa-regular fa-octagon-plus"></i> (New Project) button in the main toolbar

## Project Hirearchy

`Projects` are created and stored inside InstaMAT `Packages`. In addition to multiple projects, These packages contain any related resources that are to be bundeled with each project such as images, fonts, baked mesh maps, baking settings, meshes, and point clouds.

Package contents are viewed through the [Package Management](/Products/InstaMAT_Studio/Canvas/Canvas_Interface/Package_Management) panel.

## Integrations Features vs InstaMAT Studio

InstaMAT's Integrated Plugins allow you to bring InstaMAT package files into your preferred application for direct manipulation and seamless integration into your projects. These package files are created in InstaMAT Studio, where project types such as the `Element Graph` or a `Layering Project` can be built.
